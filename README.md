# IceFlameMagicTexture

This is an update of the original PixelBOX texture pack by the brillant artist Gambit (who is no longer active in the community).

This pack is currently up-to-date with Minetest Game and supports nearly 100% of its textures. The original pack had wrong / outdated file names or missing textures. The textures themselves have been the least modified as possible for not alterating the artwork of Gambit.
